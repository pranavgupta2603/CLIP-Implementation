# Unofficial Implementation of CLIP: Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision paper

The ```clip train.pynb``` file contains the code to train a simple CLIP model for zero-shot recognition.

I used this Github Repo - [https://github.com/moein-shariatnia/OpenAI-CLIP] - as reference to understand its implementation from scratch in Pytorch.
